				<h2 class="text-2xl">Our typical weekly meetings last about an hour. Members meet to give pitches on
					securities, discuss the direction of the fund, and vote on decisions within the fund.
					Guest Speakers: We typically have a guest speaker connect with the club every semester to
					gain insight and experience from industry professionals. Last semester we were very fortunate
					to have Texas A&M Graduate and Shelter Growth Capital Partners Founder Dan Sparks speak
					with us.</h2>

				<h2 class="text-2xl">Our goal as a club is not just about the markets, but also to find individuals who want to
